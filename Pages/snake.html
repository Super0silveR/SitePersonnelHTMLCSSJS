          <h2>About This Project</h2>
          <p>
            This snake game was very fun to make and I learned a lot from it. At
            the beginning I wanted to make a game that visitors could interact
            with. Creating something that could be interacted with and provide a
            bit of fun was interesting to conceive. Here are some of the things
            I learned from this project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Gameplay loop : The game is basically a loop that updates the
              canvas and some game states many times a second.
            </li>
            <li>
              Join input and output : Paring both quickly and seamlessly was a
              key part of making this game feel interactive and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Good UI/UX : There's a line between making the game functional and
              making it fun. Assets, sounds and even a score counter can make
              the game feel more responsive and engaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offering settings menu to adjust game speed and sound to better
              fit the user's preferences.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using a canvas for the game was maybe not the best choice, but it
            was a good learning experience. As long as it represented what I
            expected the game to be, it was a good choice. There's more of
            course that could be added, such as levels, custom colors and more
            game mechanics. But for now, this is a good start.
