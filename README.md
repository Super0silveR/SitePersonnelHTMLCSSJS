## About the Project
#### Overview

This website is my portfolio, it's the door to the things I do and learn about. There's a lot of cool stuff to learn and I love to have a place where I can showcase my skills and new discoveries. The website currently lacks a lot of features to my liking as I've restricted the development to only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a lot of cool frameworks out there, but I want to solidify my basics to understand fully why they're helpful.

As I learn more, this website may include more and more technologies and frameworks. But for Version 1.0, it's good enough as a proof of concept.

## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites

A working machine capable of reading HTML files.
A browser.

#### Installation

Simply just clone this repo. Use your favorite method or use:

```bash
